## Sample Brutal Questions

1. "In what year did the Eureka Stockade rebellion occur in Ballarat?" (1854)
2. "Which Australian Prime Minister disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach in 1967?" (Harold Holt)
3. "What is the Aboriginal name for the Olgas rock formation?" (Kata Tjuta)
4. "Who wrote 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra'?" (Nietzsche)
5. "What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?"
6. "Which Australian Prime Minister served the shortest term?" (Frank Forde)
7. "What year did the Australian Labor Party split, leading to the formation of the DLP?" (1955)

## Difficulty Philosophy

The game is designed so that:
- Questions 1-7: Most players can answer
- Questions 8-10: Requires good general knowledge
- Questions 11-15: **Requires expert-level knowledge in Australian history, culture, and obscure academic subjects**

The final 5 questions are intentionally brutal - combining:
- Obscure Australian historical facts
- Technical scientific knowledge
- Specialized cultural information
- Academic-level content

## Expected Outcome

With this difficulty curve, winning $1,000,000 should be extremely rare. Most players will:
- Easily reach $1,000 (Question 5)
- Struggle around $8,000-$32,000 (Questions 8-10)
- Find Questions 11-15 nearly impossible without specialized knowledge

This creates the authentic "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" tension where the million-dollar question is genuinely difficult to answer.
